# 🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis using SQL & Power BI

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of traffic accidents using **SQL** and **Power BI**, focusing on various factors contributing to accident frequency and severity. The project consists of **SQL-based data analysis** and a **Power BI dashboard**, offering detailed insights into accident trends, severity factors, and safety recommendations.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze traffic accident data to uncover trends, identify key factors associated with accident severity, and provide insights that could help in reducing traffic-related fatalities. The analysis is performed using SQL queries on a dataset that includes attributes such as accident types, weather conditions, road conditions, and driver demographics. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard provides **interactive visualizations** of accident statistics, spatial distribution, and severity analysis.

## 📁 Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis includes records of traffic accidents, detailing information such as:
- Number of vehicles involved
- Fatalities and injuries
- Accident types
- Weather and light conditions
- Road conditions
- Driver demographics
